# Cities on World Map

- This project is an extension to one of my previous projects which is world map plot using D3 and React.
- The addition feature which I have worked on in this project is plotting cities on the map
- The cities are marked based on its population i.e., the radius of the circle which represents a particular city is proportional to the population.
- The world map data is from [World Atlas](https://unpkg.com/world-atlas@2.0.2/countries-50m.json)
- The Cities data is from Simplemaps: [World Cities Database](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities)

## Tech/Libraries Used
